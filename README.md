![wio terminal](https://files.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Wio-Terminal/img/Wio-Terminal-Wiki.jpg)

## Overview

Seeed Studio is committed to the open-source hardware movement, and in that spirit, we have taken this a step further into open manufacturing. We wish to make it possible for anyone to reproduce and manufacture this device. We believe that opening the manufacturing process will unlock immense potential for innovation and creativity.
Welcome to the Wio Terminal project, an open-source hardware initiative developed and maintained by Seeed Studio. The Wio Terminal is not just a highly integrated microcontroller, it is also a widely acknowledged and used IoT development platform. Compatible with Arduino and MicroPython, it supports both Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, providing strong support for IoT projects. Whether it is in smart homes, industrial automation, or educational research, Wio Terminal exhibits its powerful functionality and versatility.

Seeed Studio has been committed to the open-source hardware movement, and now we wish to push this a step further into open manufacturing. We are not only making our hardware designs public but going further to provide all files and information required for manufacturing, allowing anyone to freely replicate, produce, and even commercialize the Wio Terminal. We believe that open manufacturing will facilitate innovation, allowing more people to participate in hardware design and improvement, and collectively promote the development of hardware technology. We look forward to seeing your versions and encourage you to share your designs and ideas on this platform.
