These are firmware files for the Wio Terminal development board, and here are the descriptions after each file name represent different versions and functions of the firmware:

1. F4_WioTermianal_final_all.ino.bin: Test firmware that includes all functions.
2. F3_WioTerminal_fianl_no_bt.bin: Test firmware that does not include Bluetooth functionality.
3. F2_firmware_for_enduser.bin: Firmware for end users.
4. F1_bootloader_unlocked.ino.bin: Firmware that unlocks the bootloader and allows firmware to be burned.

On top of these firmware versions, there are also versions that have added new test steps or fixed some issues:

5. F4_WioTermianal_final_all.ino_v2.bin: Added test steps for whether the module is calibrated, including reading E-Fuse content and determining whether MAC address is written.
6. F3_WioTerminal_fianl_no_bt_v2.bin: Added test steps for whether calibration is performed, without Bluetooth functionality.
7. F4_WioTermianal_final_all.ino_v3.bin: Fixed issues in Pi Header GPIO test by adding 1 to the array count.
8. F3_WioTerminal_fianl_no_bt_v3.bin: Version without Bluetooth functionality, corresponding to F4_WioTermianal_final_all.ino_v3.bin.

In addition, there are versions marked with dates:

9. F3_WioterminalTestCode20200529.bin: RTL8720DN module firmware updated on May 29, 2020, for test firmware.
10. F3_WioterminalTestCode20200620.bin: Test firmware that added three switch function tests before welding the screen on June 20, 2020.
11. F3_WioterminalTestCode20200624.bin: Test firmware that added MP mode confirmation for calibration and WiFi scan on June 24, 2020.

Finally, there is a firmware dedicated to debugging:

12. F4_wifi_scan.ino.bin: Test firmware that added WiFi scan testing on July 8, 2022, only for debugging purposes.

Additionally, WioTerminalDebug.ino.bin is a firmware for manually confirming module functionality. It includes operations such as setting the module to MP mode, reading module E-Fuse data, instructing the module to scan WiFi, setting the module to normal mode, scanning WiFi in SPI mode, and reading module firmware version in SPI mode.

P 2 0 --> Set the module to MP mode
P 2 1 --> Read module E-Fuse data through the serial port
P 2 2 --> Instruct the module to scan WiFi through the serial port
P 3 0 --> Set the module to normal mode
P 4 --> Scan WiFi in SPI mode
